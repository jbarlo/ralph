# Ralph Progress Log

Append-only log of completed work. Each iteration adds to this file.

## Ticket #1: Create hooks.d directory structure
- Updated bin/ralph-init to create hooks.d/ directory with subdirectories: on-start/, on-complete/, on-error/
- Each subdirectory contains a .gitkeep file for git tracking
- Idempotent: skips creation if hooks.d/ already exists
- Files changed: bin/ralph-init
- Tests: verified directory structure created correctly, verified idempotence
