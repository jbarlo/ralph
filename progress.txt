# Ralph Progress Log

Append-only log of completed work. Each iteration adds to this file.

---

## Ticket #1: Create hooks.d directory structure
- Updated bin/ralph-init to create hooks.d/ directory with subdirectories: on-start/, on-complete/, on-error/
- Each subdirectory contains a .gitkeep file for git tracking
- Idempotent: skips creation if hooks.d/ already exists
- Files changed: bin/ralph-init
- Tests: verified directory structure created correctly, verified idempotence

## Ticket #2: Create ralph-hooks executor script
- Created bin/ralph-hooks script to execute lifecycle hooks
- Finds all executable files in hooks.d/<event>/ directory
- Executes hooks in lexicographic order (01-first, 02-second, etc.)
- Passes JSON context via stdin, RALPH_HOOK_EVENT, and RALPH_HOOK_CONTEXT env vars
- Continues on failure, collects errors, reports at end
- Exits 0 if no hooks or all succeed, exits 1 if any fail
- Files changed: bin/ralph-hooks (new)
- Tests: verified with test hooks for success, failure, and continuation behavior
